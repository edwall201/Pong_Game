# Pong Game (Verilog Implementation)

A hardware implementation of the classic **Pong arcade game** written in **Verilog HDL**.  
This project demonstrates how to implement game logic, VGA display control, and input handling using digital hardware design.

---

## Overview

This repository contains a Verilog-based implementation of the classic Pong game.  
The design is intended for simulation or FPGA deployment and includes paddle control, ball movement, collision detection, and VGA output for real-time gameplay.

## Controls

Controls depend on your hardware setup, but a typical configuration is:

| Input | Action |
|------|--------|
| Button Up | Move paddle up |
| Button Down | Move paddle down |
| Reset | Restart the game |
